# Task8-Sales-Dashboard-and-Insight
A simple interactive sales dashboard created using Tableau 

 Overview

This project presents an interactive sales dashboard created using Tableau as part of a data analysis exercise. The dashboard provides key visualizations to help understand sales performance across time, regions, and product categories using the Superstore dataset.

The primary objective was to deliver a clean and informative view of business performance metrics through visual analytics.

 Dashboard Description

The dashboard includes the following visual elements:

1. **Line Chart – Sales Over Time**  
   Displays monthly sales trends using a continuous Month-Year axis. The chart highlights seasonal peaks, particularly in November and December.

2. **Bar Chart – Sales by Region**  
   Compares total sales across different regions. The West region leads in total sales, followed by East, with South showing the least contribution.

3. **Pie Chart – Sales by Category**  
   Visualizes the proportion of sales from each product category. Technology dominates, with Furniture and Office Supplies contributing moderately.

Interactive filters are added to allow slicing the data by Region, giving users control to focus on specific geographic areas.

Key Insights

- **Sales Trend**: A steady upward trajectory is observed in monthly sales, with significant increases during November and December, indicating strong seasonal influence.

- **Regional Performance**: The West region shows the highest sales, suggesting strong customer engagement. The South region lags, signaling a need for targeted improvements.

- **Category Analysis**: Technology stands out as the most profitable category, likely due to high consumer demand. Furniture and Office Supplies also perform well but with lower sales volumes.

- **Profit vs. Sales**: Regions like Central have decent sales but lower profit margins, pointing toward the need for improved pricing and operational strategies.

 Conclusion

This dashboard effectively summarizes the sales landscape for the Superstore business. It reveals actionable insights into seasonality, regional strengths, and product category performance. The visual design enables clear communication of trends and opportunities, supporting data-driven decision-making.
